**Using Kanban Project: A Quick Guide**

*Introduction:*
Before we start, understand that this guide will help you use your Kanban efficiently.

**1. Registration:**

- First, if you're not registered:
    - Click in "Register".
    - Fill in the inputs with your details.
    - Click "Register" to create an account.

**2. Logging In:**

- If you're already registered:
    - Enter your username and password.
    - Click "Log In."

**3. Navigating the Home Page:**

- Once logged in, you'll see four columns: "New," "To Do," "Doing," and "Done."

**4. Let’s begin:**

- In the "New" column:
    - Fill in the inputs with a title and description.
    - Click "+" to add it to your board.

**5. Managing Cards:**

- Now, with the already-made card, you’ll be able to edit and delete:
    - To delete:
        - Click in the “trash can” icon.
        - If you’re sure about it, just press “Confirm”
        - If you changed you’re mind, you can press the “Cancel” button.
    - To edit:
        - Click in the “pencil-in-square” icon.
        - Then, you’ll see the previous data.
        - To change that, just input the new title or/and the new description.

**6. Moving Cards Through Columns:**

- Beside all that, you can register your progress by moving the card from one column to another.
    - If your task is in the “To Do” column and you’re working on it right now, you can move it to the “Doing” column.
    - If your tast is done, just move it to the “Done” column (that’s obvious, i know).

Now that you know how to use your Kanban, you can finally become that organized person you want it. 

Have fun!
